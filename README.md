# Never7 Eternal Edition for mobile devices
A patch to make the game playable in mobile devices (specifically Android).
## What's working
* Opening the game (couldn't open before without removing some pixel shader that for some reason doesn't work)
* Playing the game (couldn't play before because scaling problems)
* Unlocked aspect ratio (the game will be draw in a safe area where it isn't obstructed by the phone's screen notch or the system UI)
* Opening the pause menu and backlog in-game
* Scrolling in backlog, playing log and the flow menu
* Fast-forwarding (you can fast forward pressing with four fingers but it's too uncomfortable to do, perhaps I need to make it a game UI element)
## TODO
maybe refactor some stuff
## Gameplay
Playing the game with this patch requires having more than one finger in one of your hands.  
Pressing with two fingers: simulates the "escape" key (or call it right mouse button)  
Pressing with three fingers: opens the backlog
## Instructions
making it asap
